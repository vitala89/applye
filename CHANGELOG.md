# Changelog

All notable changes to Applye are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Applye is pre-1.0, so it follows `0.x` versioning: while on `0.x`, the minor
number covers new capability and the patch number covers fixes and release
plumbing. The version in `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, and `tauri.conf.json`
is the single source of truth; this file tracks what changed at each tag.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **applye.dev website** (`apps/web`): static landing page, three-zone
  documentation, a methodology page explaining the recruiter check, a blog
  placeholder, and this changelog, all on the shared design tokens.
- Lucide icon set across the desktop shell navigation and page components.

### Changed

- Disabled GitHub Actions workflows while the repository is private.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-29
