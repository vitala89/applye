# Changelog

All notable changes to Applye are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Applye is pre-1.0, so it follows `0.x` versioning: while on `0.x`, the minor
number covers new capability and the patch number covers fixes and release
plumbing. The version in `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, and `tauri.conf.json`
is the single source of truth; this file tracks what changed at each tag.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- **Import tracklist (Phase 6.4).** "Import file" in My Jobs picks a CSV,
  XLSX, JSON, or plain-text export from another job tracker via the native
  file dialog. One AI call (`import-tracklist.md`, economy model) detects
  the column structure and extracts rows — status normalization, dedupe,
  and the insert are all deterministic Rust + SQL, 0 tokens. XLSX is read
  with `calamine` (converted to CSV-like text for the AI call); CSV/JSON/
  text are forwarded as raw text.
- Preview shows a per-row checkbox table before anything is written:
  status strings ("Submitted", "Screening", "Declined", ...) normalized to
  saved/applied/interview/offer/rejected; rows matching an existing job by
  lower(company)+lower(role) are flagged as already-existing; rows the
  skill couldn't use (e.g. missing company) are listed with a reason.
  Nothing is inserted until the user confirms.
- Confirm inserts a `jobs` row (plus an `applications` row carrying the
  normalized status) per selected row, tagging `imported_from` as
  `import_csv` / `import_xlsx` / `import_json` / `import_text`. Duplicates
  are re-checked at insert time — re-importing the same file adds nothing
  twice.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- **Before-you-submit notes (Phase 6.3).** The `job-scoring.md` skill now
  also returns `before_you_submit`: 2-4 short, concrete reminders grounded in
  the job's JD and Phase 6.2 legitimacy notes (e.g. "Salary not listed —
  research market rate before applying"). Produced in the same `ai_run` call
  as the score — no second request, 0 extra tokens. Stored in
  `scoring_cache.before_you_submit_json`, part of the existing cache key
  (job, profile, JD hash, language, model), so reopening a scored job shows
  the notes at 0 tokens. Job Detail renders them as a collapsible checklist
  directly under the score section; hidden when empty.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- **Legitimacy check (Phase 6.2).** Deterministic, 0-token Rust pattern
  matching runs in the paste pipeline after the hard filter, before any AI
  scoring: green/yellow/red tier plus human-readable notes, stored on the
  job row. Yellow triggers: no salary mentioned, "wear many hats" with no
  team size, posting over 90 days old, vague "other duties as
  assigned/required" scope. Red triggers: no company name (or conflicting
  company mentions), application directed to a personal email domain
  (gmail/hotmail/yahoo/outlook.com), an implausibly wide salary range, or
  the same JD template already saved under a different company.
  Augmentation, not a gate — a red job can still be scored and tailored if
  the user chooses; My Jobs shows a badge (none/amber/red) and Job Detail
  shows the triggered notes plus a non-blocking warning banner for red.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- **Navigation restructure (Phase 5).** The sidebar is reorganised into
  Dashboard, Discover (stub), My Jobs, Pipeline, Interview Prep (stub),
  Job Tracker, Analytics (stub), and Settings.
- **My Jobs** (`/jobs`): the full job database as a sortable, filterable,
  searchable table (Company, Role, Score, Status, Legitimacy, Date Added,
  Source) over a new read-only query, with a paste-job modal.
- **Job Detail** (`/jobs/:id`): the existing scoring and 3-pass tailoring
  wizard, now opened per job (cached score shown, 0 tokens on open), with
  Add to Pipeline and Mark as Applied actions.
- **Job Tracker** (`/tracker`): the Agentur fuer Arbeit "Eigenbemuehungen"
  report. A table over applications + jobs + status history with date-range
  and status filters, a summary footer (total, response rate, avg days to
  response), and PDF / Excel(CSV) export.

### Changed

- **Pipeline** now shows only active applications (applied, interview, offer,
  rejected); saved jobs live in My Jobs. A job enters the board via Add to
  Pipeline / Mark Applied.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- **DeepSeek provider** (API mode). A new OpenAI-compatible request path in
  `ai/api.rs` routes the `deepseek` provider to `api.deepseek.com`, with the
  Anthropic path untouched. Models `deepseek-v4-pro` (quality) and
  `deepseek-v4-flash` (economy), selectable in Settings; the API key is stored
  per provider in the OS keychain, never in the database or logs.

### Security

- **Privacy disclosure for DeepSeek.** Settings shows a clear note that DeepSeek
  is a China-based cloud provider and that, in API mode, the job description and
  profile text are sent to its servers. AI remains opt-in; on-device users can
  pick another provider.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- **applye.dev website** (`apps/web`): static landing page, three-zone
  documentation, a methodology page explaining the recruiter check, a blog
  placeholder, and this changelog, all on the shared design tokens.
- Lucide icon set across the desktop shell navigation and page components.
- **Schema sync (Phase 4.5):** additive migration
  `0006_career_ops_features.sql` reconciling the live SQLite schema with
  ROADMAP §12. New columns on `profile`, `jobs`, `scoring_cache`,
  `settings`, `sources`, and `company_research`, plus two new cache tables
  (`portal_answers`, `pattern_analysis`). Purely additive: existing
  dogfooding data is preserved. Rust, `libs/core`, and `libs/data` types
  synced; no feature logic yet.

### Changed

- Disabled GitHub Actions workflows while the repository is private.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- Multi-OS release pipeline (tauri-action) with Tauri auto-updater wiring.
- Internationalization: English and German translations, plus empty, loading,
  and error states across the UI.
- Public README and an architecture overview in `docs/`.

### Changed

- Locked the DOCX and PDF export dependencies.

### Security

- Configured the updater signing public key in `tauri.conf.json`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-28

The version moved from `0.1.0` straight to `0.3.0`; `0.2.0` was never tagged.

### Added

- AI spine: `ai_run` abstraction, skill-file loader, OS keyring for secrets,
  and the Settings screen.
- Rich profile editor with a compressed scoring profile and a default pitch.
- Paste-a-job scoring with a deterministic hard filter and a hash cache.
- Three-pass CV tailoring wizard with DOCX and PDF export.
- Pipeline kanban (Angular CDK) with automatic status history.
- Design tokens and the application shell.
- Quality gates: git hooks and CI.

### Fixed

- Pipeline loading and error state converted to signals for zoneless change
  detection.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- Phase 1 data spine: SQLite schema, Tauri commands, and the profile vertical
  slice.
