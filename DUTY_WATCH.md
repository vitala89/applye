# Applye Duty Watch

This file is the chronological handoff log for maintainers and AI agents working on Applye.

`docs/product/CURRENT_STATE.md` remains the canonical operational state. This log records how each work session changed, verified, or failed to change that state.

Append new entries at the top under `## Watch Log`. Do not erase older entries to hide mistakes or incomplete work. Correct inaccurate entries with a later entry and repository evidence.

## Duty completion checklist

Before a watch can be marked complete:

- [ ] The final diff was reviewed.
- [ ] Relevant checks from `docs/governance/VALIDATION_MATRIX.md` were run.
- [ ] `npm run format:check` passed, or an unavailable formatter was reported honestly.
- [ ] `git diff --check` passed.
- [ ] `docs/product/CURRENT_STATE.md` was updated if focus, blockers, implementation status, or next action changed.
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md`, roadmap, ADRs, specs, migrations, privacy, security, and design docs were updated when applicable.
- [ ] Any failed, skipped, unavailable, or manual-only checks are recorded.
- [ ] The next first action is concrete and executable.

## Watch Log

### 2026-07-26, pre-release audit of section wiring and validation gates

- **Status:** partial
- **Agent/tool:** Claude Code
- **Branch:** `chore/release-readiness-audit`
- **Commits:** `7ad8fda` i18n fix, `71c7966` build gates, `0a9e4dd` docs
- **Pull request:** [#157](https://github.com/vitala89/applye/pull/157), open against `main`, mergeable at the time of this entry
- **Objective:** Before release prep, verify that every section is genuinely wired to every other, that the versions agree, and that the checks the repository claims to run actually run. Fix what is found.
- **Completed:**
  - **Version check.** `package.json`, `apps/desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` and `apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml` all read `0.28.0`. `CHANGELOG.md` heads at `[0.28.0] - 2026-07-26`. `apps/mobile` is a README only, as documented. No drift.
  - **Routing.** All 19 routes in `app.routes.ts` resolve, every navigation target in the app resolves to a defined route, and no route is orphaned. The three `print/*` routes are correctly unlinked (they are loaded by the hidden export window only).
  - **Tauri IPC.** 91 `#[tauri::command]` functions, all registered in `generate_handler!`, all reachable from `tauriInvoke`. One registered command, `validate_theme`, has no frontend caller; left in place deliberately (pure validator, no side effects, superseded in the UI by `check_style_safety`).
  - **Migrations.** `0001`-`0026`, gapless. `db.rs` uses `sqlx::migrate!("./migrations")`, which discovers the directory, so no hand-maintained registry can fall behind.
  - **Dash ban.** Three remaining en dashes, all parser-input test fixtures, matching what `CURRENT_STATE.md` already records as deliberate.
  - **Render pass.** All eleven top-level pages render in the browser preview with no unexpected console error. The only errors are the expected `tauriInvoke called outside Tauri context`; sections degrade to their empty states rather than crashing.
  - **Fix 1, user-visible.** `stub()` in `translations.ts` layered the four partial locales over English with a shallow spread, so any section a locale overrode lost every English key that locale omitted, and `resolve()` renders a missing key as the key itself. ru/es/fr/uk showed `actions.close` on the job-paste, CV-import, My Jobs import and pipeline quick-view dialogs and `common.back` / `common.next` in the apply wizard. `stub()` now deep-merges. Key counts before: en/de 1438, ru/es/fr/uk 1435. After: 1438 in all six.
  - **Fix 2, process gate.** `npm run type-check` ran zero tasks (`NX No tasks were run`, exit 0) because no project defined the target, while `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` and the validation matrix all require it before commit. Added a `type-check` target to all six projects running `tsc --noEmit` on the project's app/lib tsconfig.
  - **Fix 3, process gate.** `libs/core` had `eslint.config.mjs` but no `lint` target, so `npm run lint` silently covered five of six projects. Added.
  - **Regression guard.** `translate.service.spec.ts` gained a parity test asserting every English key resolves in every locale, plus explicit cases for the three keys that were lost. Its existing "falls back to English" test asserted `tFor('en')` rather than a partial locale, so it could never have caught this; it now uses `ru`.
- **Not completed:** The native `tauri dev` gate. Nothing in this watch reaches Tauri IPC, SQLite, the keychain or native dialogs, so the CLI-bridge Settings and onboarding UI, the ATS card, the assisted installer and Interview Prep's stage CRUD remain unverified natively - exactly as the previous entry left them.
- **Files or packages changed:** `libs/i18n/src/lib/translations/translations.ts`, `libs/i18n/src/lib/i18n/translate.service.spec.ts`, `project.json` for `desktop`, `web`, `core`, `data`, `i18n`, `ui`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/product/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `DUTY_WATCH.md`. No application feature code changed.
- **Validation:** Run and observed on this branch: `npm run type-check` (6 projects, pass - meaningful for the first time), `npm run lint` (6 projects, pass; `core` contributes 11 warnings, 0 errors, all pre-existing), `npm test` (6 projects, pass; `i18n` 5 -> 14 tests), `npm run format:check` (pass), `nx build desktop` (pass), `npm run web:build` (pass, 39 static routes), `cargo fmt --check` (pass), `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` (pass), `cargo test --lib` (272 passed, 1 ignored), `git diff --check` (clean). **Not run:** `tauri dev`. `apps/web/public/sitemap.xml` was regenerated as a side effect of `web:build` and reverted, since only its `lastmod` dates moved.
- **Privacy/security impact:** None. No user data, storage, network, IPC surface, permission or AI provider behavior changed. The i18n fix is presentation-only and touches no stored value.
- **Decisions and assumptions:** `stub()` was fixed rather than the four locales being completed by hand, because a shallow merge re-breaks on the next key added to `en` while a deep merge cannot. `type-check` targets check the app/lib tsconfigs, not the spec ones: the spec configs use `module: commonjs` with `moduleResolution: node10` for `jest-preset-angular`, under which `@angular/core/testing` cannot resolve. Spec files are still type-checked, by ts-jest during `nx test`. `validate_theme` was left registered rather than removed, since removing an IPC command is a behavior change and was not asked for.
- **Risks or compatibility impact:** The deep merge changes what ru/es/fr/uk resolve for keys their bundles omitted - from the key name to English text. That is the intended fix and cannot regress a translated string, since a leaf the locale does define still wins. `type-check` and `core:lint` are new gates: they pass today, but they will now fail builds that previously slipped through, which is the point.
- **Open issues or blockers:** The native gate is the only thing between this branch and release prep. Two smaller observations, neither fixed and neither a blocker: the dashboard greeting treats every hour before noon as morning, so 1 a.m. reads "Good morning"; and `apps/web/tools/generate-sitemap.mjs` stamps today's date as `lastmod` on every URL whether or not the page changed.
- **Next first action:** Run `npm run desktop:dev` and walk the five never-natively-verified surfaces in order: CLI-bridge Settings, the onboarding AI step, the ATS card, the assisted installer, and Interview Prep stage add/edit/delete/reorder. Record each as pass or fail in the next watch entry.
- **Evidence:** Branch diff; check output quoted above; locale key counts before and after produced by extracting every leaf of `TRANSLATIONS` and diffing each locale against `en`.

### 2026-07-24, adopt Intentloom Duty Watch

- **Status:** complete
- **Agent/tool:** ChatGPT with GitHub connector
- **Branch:** `chore/adopt-intentloom-duty-watch`
- **Commits:** documentation commits on the branch
- **Pull request:** pending at the time of this entry
- **Objective:** Migrate Applye's existing AIF operating rules to the Intentloom Duty Watch workflow without duplicating the existing current-state system.
- **Completed:** Added the required agent entrypoint, Duty Watch log, project-specific validation matrix, and stronger default instructions for accepting and relieving a watch.
- **Not completed:** No runtime code, package dependency, automatic Intentloom pack installation, or security scanner integration was added.
- **Files or packages changed:** `AGENT_START_HERE.md`, `DUTY_WATCH.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `docs/governance/VALIDATION_MATRIX.md`.
- **Validation:** Documentation-only review. Repository CI may be unavailable because Applye's normal CI workflow is currently disabled; the PR must report the actual checks observed.
- **Privacy/security impact:** No user data, secrets, Tauri permissions, AI provider behavior, or network behavior changed.
- **Decisions and assumptions:** `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` stays the durable context source and `docs/product/CURRENT_STATE.md` stays the single operational state source. No duplicate `PROJECT_STATE.md` is introduced.
- **Risks or compatibility impact:** Agents that ignore repository instruction files cannot be forced by Git alone. Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity, and similar tools should be configured to honor repository instructions.
- **Open issues or blockers:** The portable Duty Watch pack is not yet implemented in Intentloom; this is a manual reference adoption.
- **Next first action:** Review and merge the adoption PR, then begin every new Applye session from `AGENT_START_HERE.md`.
- **Evidence:** Branch diff and pull request history.
