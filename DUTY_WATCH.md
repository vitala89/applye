# Applye Duty Watch

This file is the chronological handoff log for maintainers and AI agents working on Applye.

`docs/product/CURRENT_STATE.md` remains the canonical operational state. This log records how each work session changed, verified, or failed to change that state.

Append new entries at the top under `## Watch Log`. Do not erase older entries to hide mistakes or incomplete work. Correct inaccurate entries with a later entry and repository evidence.

## Duty completion checklist

Before a watch can be marked complete:

- [ ] The final diff was reviewed.
- [ ] Relevant checks from `docs/governance/VALIDATION_MATRIX.md` were run.
- [ ] `npm run format:check` passed, or an unavailable formatter was reported honestly.
- [ ] `git diff --check` passed.
- [ ] `docs/product/CURRENT_STATE.md` was updated if focus, blockers, implementation status, or next action changed.
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md`, roadmap, ADRs, specs, migrations, privacy, security, and design docs were updated when applicable.
- [ ] Any failed, skipped, unavailable, or manual-only checks are recorded.
- [ ] The next first action is concrete and executable.

## Watch Log

### 2026-07-24, adopt Intentloom Duty Watch

- **Status:** complete
- **Agent/tool:** ChatGPT with GitHub connector
- **Branch:** `chore/adopt-intentloom-duty-watch`
- **Commits:** documentation commits on the branch
- **Pull request:** pending at the time of this entry
- **Objective:** Migrate Applye's existing AIF operating rules to the Intentloom Duty Watch workflow without duplicating the existing current-state system.
- **Completed:** Added the required agent entrypoint, Duty Watch log, project-specific validation matrix, and stronger default instructions for accepting and relieving a watch.
- **Not completed:** No runtime code, package dependency, automatic Intentloom pack installation, or security scanner integration was added.
- **Files or packages changed:** `AGENT_START_HERE.md`, `DUTY_WATCH.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `docs/governance/VALIDATION_MATRIX.md`.
- **Validation:** Documentation-only review. Repository CI may be unavailable because Applye's normal CI workflow is currently disabled; the PR must report the actual checks observed.
- **Privacy/security impact:** No user data, secrets, Tauri permissions, AI provider behavior, or network behavior changed.
- **Decisions and assumptions:** `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` stays the durable context source and `docs/product/CURRENT_STATE.md` stays the single operational state source. No duplicate `PROJECT_STATE.md` is introduced.
- **Risks or compatibility impact:** Agents that ignore repository instruction files cannot be forced by Git alone. Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity, and similar tools should be configured to honor repository instructions.
- **Open issues or blockers:** The portable Duty Watch pack is not yet implemented in Intentloom; this is a manual reference adoption.
- **Next first action:** Review and merge the adoption PR, then begin every new Applye session from `AGENT_START_HERE.md`.
- **Evidence:** Branch diff and pull request history.
